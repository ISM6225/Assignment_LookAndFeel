    <h2>Health Impact of Air Quality</h2>
    
    <p>
        The quality of the air we breathe significantly influences our overall health and well-being. Poor air quality, often caused by pollutants such as particulate matter and ozone, can lead to various health complications. Understanding these impacts is crucial for taking proactive measures for health protection, particularly in urban areas like New York City, where environmental factors can intensify pollution levels.
    </p>
         <h3>PM2.5 (Fine Particulate Matter)</h3>
 <p>
     PM2.5, tiny particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter, poses significant health risks. These particles are small enough to penetrate deep into the lungs and even enter the bloodstream, potentially causing severe cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and respiratory damage. Long-term exposure to PM2.5 can lead to an increased risk of heart attacks and strokes, impaired lung function, and exacerbated respiratory conditions, such as asthma and chronic bronchitis.
 </p>

 <h3>Ozone (O3)</h3>
 <p>
     Ground-level ozone, a major component of smog, is most commonly formed through reactions between nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the presence of sunlight. Ozone can irritate the respiratory system, leading to coughing, throat irritation, and worsening of bronchitis, emphysema, and asthma. Long-term exposure may lead to decreased lung function and increased rates of chronic respiratory diseases.

     <h3>Preventive Measures</h3>
     <p>It's essential to be proactive in protecting yourself from poor air quality. Here are some preventive measures you can take:</p>
     <ul>
         <li><strong>Indoor Air Quality</strong>: Consider using air purifiers, especially those with HEPA filters, to reduce indoor pollutants. Certain indoor plants, such as spider plants and snake plants, can also help improve indoor air quality.</li>
         <li><strong>Limiting Outdoor Activities</strong>: On days when the air quality is particularly poor, try to limit your time outdoors, especially during peak pollution times like rush hour.</li>
         <li><strong>Using Masks</strong>: Wearing masks, particularly those designed to filter out pollutants, can be effective in reducing your exposure to harmful particles in the air.</li>
     </ul>

         <section class="section">
     <h3>Children and Vulnerable Groups</h3>
     <p>Children, the elderly, and individuals with pre-existing health conditions are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of poor air quality:</p>
     <ul>
         <li><strong>Children</strong>: Their lungs are still developing, making them more susceptible to pollutants. Ensure they limit outdoor activities during high pollution periods and have access to clean indoor air.</li>
         <li><strong>Elderly</strong>: Aging lungs and pre-existing health conditions can make seniors more susceptible to respiratory and cardiovascular issues due to pollutants.</li>
         <li><strong>People with Health Conditions</strong>: Those with conditions like asthma, cardiovascular disease, or other respiratory problems should be particularly cautious and monitor air quality regularly.</li>
     </ul>

    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h3>
    <div>
        <h4>Q: How do I check the current air quality in my area?</h4>
        <p>A: There are various online platforms and mobile applications that provide real-time air quality indices. It's recommended to check one of these resources before planning outdoor activities.</p>
