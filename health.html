        <h2>Health Impact of Air Quality</h2>
        <div class="intro-section">
    <p>
        Air quality is an essential determinant of health, impacting millions globally. While we often associate air with life, giving us oxygen to breathe, the very same air can become a silent threat when polluted. The contaminants present in polluted air can infiltrate our systems, leading to a multitude of health concerns, both short-term and long-term.
    </p>
    <p>
        As urbanization and industrial activities grow, so does the concern about the quality of the air we breathe. The pollutants can range from tiny particulate matter, barely visible to the naked eye, to harmful gases. Each of these pollutants has its own health effects, with some causing immediate harm, while others affect us over extended periods of exposure.
    </p>
    <p>
        Understanding the health implications of various air quality indicators is crucial. It not only helps individuals take preventive measures but also drives policy decisions on a larger scale. This section delves into the health impacts of prominent air quality indicators, shedding light on why it's imperative to monitor and act upon deteriorating air quality.
    </p>

       <h3>Key Air Quality Indicators & Their Impact</h3>
<div class="horizontal-boxes">
    <!-- PM2.5 -->
    <div class="info-box">
        <h4>PM2.5 (Fine Particulate Matter)</h4>
        <p>These particles can be inhaled deeply, possibly causing heart attacks, worsening asthma, and decreasing lung function.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Ozone -->
    <div class="info-box">
        <h4>Ozone (O3)</h4>
        <p>Ground-level ozone can trigger health issues, especially for vulnerable groups like children and the elderly.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Nitrogen Dioxide -->
    <div class="info-box">
        <h4>Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2)</h4>
        <p>High NO2 levels can irritate the lungs and lower resistance to respiratory infections.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Sulfur Dioxide -->
    <div class="info-box">
        <h4>Sulfur Dioxide (SO2)</h4>
        <p>Exposure to SO2 can harm the human respiratory system and make breathing difficult.</p>
    </div>

            <h3>Preventive Measures</h3>
            <p>It's essential to be proactive in protecting yourself from poor air quality. Here are some preventive measures you can take:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Indoor Air Quality</strong>: Consider using air purifiers, especially those with HEPA filters, to reduce indoor pollutants. Certain indoor plants, such as spider plants and snake plants, can also help improve indoor air quality.</li>
                <li><strong>Limiting Outdoor Activities</strong>: On days when the air quality is particularly poor, try to limit your time outdoors, especially during peak pollution times like rush hour.</li>
                <li><strong>Using Masks</strong>: Wearing masks, particularly those designed to filter out pollutants, can be effective in reducing your exposure to harmful particles in the air.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h3>Children and Vulnerable Groups</h3>
            <p>Children, the elderly, and individuals with pre-existing health conditions are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of poor air quality:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Children</strong>: Their lungs are still developing, making them more susceptible to pollutants. Ensure they limit outdoor activities during high pollution periods and have access to clean indoor air.</li>
                <li><strong>Elderly</strong>: Aging lungs and pre-existing health conditions can make seniors more susceptible to respiratory and cardiovascular issues due to pollutants.</li>
                <li><strong>People with Health Conditions</strong>: Those with conditions like asthma, cardiovascular disease, or other respiratory problems should be particularly cautious and monitor air quality regularly.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h3>
            <div>
                <h4>Q: How do I check the current air quality in my area?</h4>
                <p>A: There are various online platforms and mobile applications that provide real-time air quality indices. It's recommended to check one of these resources before planning outdoor activities.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Q: Are masks effective in protecting against all pollutants?</h4>
                <p>A: While masks, especially those with specific filters, can be effective against larger particles, they might not filter out all gaseous pollutants. It's essential to choose the right mask and ensure a proper fit.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Q: How can I improve the air quality inside my home?</h4>
                <p>A: Regularly cleaning and dusting, using air purifiers, ensuring good ventilation, and keeping indoor plants can help improve indoor air quality. It's also essential to avoid smoking indoors and limit the use of products that can release harmful chemicals.</p>
